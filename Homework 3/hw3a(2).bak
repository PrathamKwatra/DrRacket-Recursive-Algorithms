; Question 3a: Simple Sequential Substitution

;input-spec L1 is a list (possibly nested list)
; substitution is a pair (A1 B1) where A1 and B1 are expressions or values
;output-spec  every item of L1 which is equal (matches
; to A1 has B1 instead in the result.  Racket doesn't change list
; it creates a new structure where values in it are either copied over from
; the input L1, or are substitute values.
(define (substitute L1 substitution)
  '() ;Implement Me
  )

(module+ test
  (check-equal? (substitute '(1 2 3) '(2 7)) '(1 7 3)
     " one item substitution of a value")
  (check-not-equal? (substitute '() '(2 7)) '(1 7 3) 
    " one item substitution of a value")
  (check-equal? (substitute '(a b c) '(c (7 8 ))) '(a b (7 8))
     " one item substitution of a list")
  (check-equal? (substitute '(c a b c) '(c (7 8 ))) '((7 8) a b (7 8)) 
    " one item substitution of a list, more than once")
  ; add a few more tests here

; Question 3b: Second Sequential Substitution

;input-spec L1 is a list (possibly nested list)
; substitution1 and substitution2 are both pairs (A1 B1) and (A2 B2)
; where Ai and Bi are expressions or values.  
;output-spec  first substitutions are done of B1 for A1.  Then in that
; result substitutions are done of B2 for A2.  So if A2 is the same as B1
; then two changes might happen.
(define (sequentialSubstitute2 L1 substitution1 substitution2)
  '() ;Implement Me
  )

(module+ test
  (check-equal? (sequentialSubstitute2 '(1 3 (1 5) 3) '(3 (1 5)) '((1 5) 17)) '(1 17 17 17))
  (check-not-equal? (sequentialSubstitute2 '(1 3 (1 5) 3) '(3 (1 5)) '((1 5) 17)) '(1 (1 5)  17 (1 5)))
  )

; Question 3c: Several Sequential Substitutions

;input-spec L1 is a list (possibly nested list)
; substitutions is a list of pairs ( (A1 B1) (A2 B2) ... (An Bn)
; where Ai and Bi are expressions or values.  
;output-spec  Each specified substitution is applied to the result
; of the previous substitution.  So for each Aj  the same as some Bi for
;i<j, multiple changes might happen.
(define (sequentialSubstitute L1 substitutions)
  '() ;Implement Me
  )

(module+ test
  (check-equal? (sequentialSubstitute '(1 2 3) '( ( 1 2) (2 3) (3 4))) '(4 4 4))
  (check-not-equal? (sequentialSubstitute '(1 2 3) '( ( 1 2) (2 3) (3 4))) '(2 3 4))
  )

;input-spec expr is a list (possibly nested list)
; substitutions is a list of pairs ( (A1 B1) (A2 B2) ... (An Bn)
; where Ai and Bi are expressions or values.  
;output-spec  Each specified substitution is applied to the result
; of the previous substitution in parallel. For each element only a single
; substitution should be made. If there are two substitutions (1 2) and (2 3),
; then all 1s should be replaced with 2s, and 2s with 3s, but 1s should not be
; replaced with 3s. In addition, any sublist within expr that contains an expression that needs
; to be substituted must also be substituted.
